                    今天碰到了Git的Permission Denied问题。

                    在安装好git之后，我们一般会配置用户名和邮箱

                    git config --global user.name "zengjinlong" #--global表明本机的所有git仓库均使用该配置

                    git config --global user.email "zengjinlong@xunlei.com"

                    但是当我们克隆一个库的时候，发现不论你怎么输入密码都是说Permission Denied。

                    其实，这是你没有生成公钥

                    找到这个页面：

                    SSH Keys

                    SSH key allows you to establish a secure connection between your computer and GitLab

                    Before generating an SSH key, check if your system already has one by running cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub If your see a long string starting with ssh-rsa or ssh-dsa, you can skip the ssh-keygen step.

                    To generate a new SSH key just open your terminal and use code below. The ssh-keygen command prompts you for a location and filename to store the key pair and for a password. When prompted for the location and filename you can press enter to use the default. It is a best practice to use a password for an SSH key but it is not required and you can skip creating a password by pressing enter. Note that the password you choose here can't be altered or retrieved.

                    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "$your_email"

                    Use the code below to show your public key.

                    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

                    Copy-paste the key to the 'My SSH Keys' section under the 'SSH' tab in your user profile. Please copy the complete key starting with ssh- and ending with your username and host.

                    很简单，就是用你的邮箱生成一个公钥，然后加入到你的代码管理网站中。然后在如下页面中加入SSH Key到项目中。

                    My SSH keys
                    Add SSH Key
                    SSH keys allow you to establish a secure connection between your computer and GitLab

                    Before you can add an SSH key you need to  generate it

                    然后再git clone 一次，发现可以了。好了。这个问题解决。
